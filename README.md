# dojo-wikipedia-game

Attempt to go from one Wikipedia page to another using the API, and brute-force. Is not too slow as we used JSON and the API responses don't include the whole page but just the links.

In our test we tried to get from "Cheese" to "Jesus". We didn't have time to actually output the resulting path.

Requires `requests`.
